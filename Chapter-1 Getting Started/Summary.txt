Top reasons for learning in C:
    1. Good base for learning C#, C++, Java
    2. Unix, Linux, Windows, Gaming Frameworks are written in C
    3. Embedded systems programs are written in C.

Constants= Literals-> Cannot change
Variables= Identifiers -> MAy change

Types of variables and constants: primary, Secondary
Primary: Integer, Real(float), Character

Ranges:
    1. 2-byte integers: -32768 to +32767
    2. 4-byte integers: -2147483648 to +2147483647
    3. floats: -3.4*10^38 to +3.4*10^38

In a char constant, both qoutes must slant to the left, like 'A'

Variable has 2 meanings:
    1. It's an entity whose value can change
    2. It's a name given to a location in memory

Variables names are case-sensitive and must begin with an alphabet.

Total keywords=32, Example- char, int, float etc

printf() is a function that can print multiple constants and variables.

Format specifiers in printf(), scanf(): int: %d, float: %f, char: %C

main() is a function that must always return an integer value: 
    0 if it meets success,
    1 if it encounters failure

void main() is wrong, correct form is int main()

use /*......*/ or // for a comment in a programs

& is 'address of operator' and must be used before a variable in scanf()
